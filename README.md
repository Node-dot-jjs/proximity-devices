# Contains Python scripts for the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi Zero is configured as a headless platform, and runs Kali Linux. Using penetration testing tools, it gather information about MAC addresses in the surrounding area to determine how busy locations are. This information is then parsed before being sent to the back-end.

A single Python script accomplishes these tasks.

To-do:
- [ ] Make the script independent of user input (auto run and auto reboot)
- [ ] Re-work how the device switches to and from monitoring mode
- [ ] Re-format the scripts in a more readable format
